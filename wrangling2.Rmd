# Overview
This is an exercise for the Springboard Data Foundations course. In each step
we'll look at the data from the Titanic and fill in missing data.

0. Load the data
#. Port of embarcation
#. Age
#. Lifeboat
#. Cabin


# Load the data
We're going to load the original Excel spreadsheet, *titanic3.xls*. We'll
save an as-is copy as *titanic_original.csv*.
```{r}
titanic_orig <- read.csv("titanic3_original.csv")
titanic_clean <- titanic_orig
```
